Welcome to the `DevFlow Forge` tool.

This is a tool that allows developers to create github repositories already with a company/team standard structure, organization, architecture, rules and in the future to have the infratructure already configured. So that the process of seting up and configure a repository for a new app or project would be at a distance of one click.
