## Introduction

The idead here is to build a tool using Terraform that allows developers to create github repositorys already with a company standard structure, organization and rules. Having a Golang API that has an endpoint that the developers can use to ask for the repo creation and then Terraform does the rest.

I think this approach can be a powerful way to enforce company standards, structure, and rules for GitHub repositories while providing developers with a streamlined automated process for creating repositories. I think it can empower developers with a self-service mechanism for creating repositories while maintaining control over the repository structure and rules.

Is it a good idea? Well I think so! Especially when a company has specific standards and requirements for GitHub repositories that need to be consistently applied. This approach can help ensure consistency, reduce manual setup time, and enforce best practices across repositories.

Overall, this is just an initial solution that can serve as a foundation for building a comprehensive DevOps ecosystem that empowers development teams, enforces best practices, and enhances collaboration and efficiency across the organization. And potentially be a product/service/solution to be provisioned, managed and maintained by our team.

## Advantages

Implementing this solution to automate GitHub repository creation with company standards can offer several powerful benefits for a real company with multiple development teams:

- **Consistency and Standardization:** By enforcing a predefined repository structure, labels, issue templates, and other configurations through automation, we can ensure that all repositories across the company follow the same standards. This consistency simplifies collaboration, improves code quality, and reduces confusion.
- **Time Savings and Efficiency:** Developers no longer need to manually set up repositories and configurations, saving time and reducing human errors. They can focus more on writing code and building features, increasing overall development efficiency.
- **Centralized Governance:** With a centralized API-driven approach, the company can maintain better control over repository creation and ensure that security and compliance requirements are met consistently.
- **Scalability:** As the company grows and more repositories are created, the automation ensures that the process remains efficient and standardized, even at a larger scale.
- **Reduced Onboarding Time:** New developers joining the company can quickly get started with their work since they don't need to learn and set up repository structures and configurations manually.
- **Flexibility and Customization:** The Go API and Terraform configuration can be designed to accommodate various types of repositories, allowing teams to customize certain aspects while still adhering to the company's overarching standards.
- **Auditability and Tracking:** Automated processes provide an audit trail of repository creation activities, making it easier to track changes, identify issues, and enforce accountability.

## Approach

1. **Terraform Configuration:** Create a Terraform configuration that defines the company's standard GitHub repository structure, organization, and rules. This might include things like branch protection rules, labels, issue templates, pull request templates, and much more. (The idea is to have a Terraform configuration built by modules ready to be scalable).
2. **Golang API:** Build a Golang API that serves as the interface for developers to request repository creation. This API can take input from developers, such as the repository name, description, and any other necessary parameters.
3. **Terraform Execution:** When a request is made through the API, the Golang application can trigger the execution of the appropriate Terraform configuration using the Terraform CLI or a Terraform SDK. The API can pass the necessary parameters to Terraform, and Terraform will then create the GitHub repository with the defined structure and rules.
4. **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for the Golang API to ensure that only authorized users can create repositories and that they adhere to the company's policies.
5. **Feedback and Notifications:** Implement feedback and notification mechanisms to inform developers about the status of their repository creation request. This could include success/failure messages, links to the newly created repository, and any other relevant information.

## Opportunities and Next steps

After successfully implementing this tool, I see some features than can be implemented, extending it or integrating it with other state-of-the-art solutions:

1. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):** Extend the automation to trigger CI/CD pipelines upon repository creation. This can automate the build, testing, and deployment processes, further streamlining development workflows.
2. **ChatOps Integration:** Integrate this service with chat platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams to allow developers to request repository creation and receive notifications directly from their chat channels.
3. **Self-Service DevOps Portal:** Develop a self-service portal where developers can request repository creation, manage their repositories, and access other development tools and resources.
4. **Version Control Policies:** Implement automation to enforce version control policies, such as requiring specific labels before merging pull requests or automating code reviews.
5. **Documentation Generation:** Automatically generate initial documentation templates based on the repository's purpose, helping teams maintain consistent documentation practices.
6. **Automated Code Analysis:** Integrate tools for automated code analysis and security scanning as part of the repository creation process.
7. **Resource Provisioning:** Extend the automation to provision additional resources like cloud infrastructure, databases, and services that are commonly needed for new repositories.
8. **Repository Lifecycle Management:** Implement processes for archiving, deprecation, or deletion of repositories that are no longer needed, reducing clutter and maintaining a clean repository landscape.
